I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete the workshops and assignments.

THe STL that I used in this workshop is as follows:
   - std::for_each()
      I used this function to iterate through the vector or list of Crime objects.

   - std::accumulate()
      I used this function to count the total number of cases of the data.

   - std::sort()
      I used this function to sort the data in different orders.

   - std::transform()
      I used this function to change the crimes from "[None]" to ""

   - std::any_of()
      I used this function to check if the name was inside the container.

   - std::copy_if
      I used this function to extract a list of Crime that matches the crime name
      given.
   
The advantages of using the STL algorithms compared to implementing them myself are
they are optimized to be using with STL containers, more efficient, easier to read
and they are more scalable. Meaning that it is easier to make bigger projects with 
the use of the STL algorithms.

In the sort function, it receives a parameter (the field) which would then sort the
data by that field. Errors can occur when the parameter being entered is not a field
in the data. I would design a try and catch method to avoid unknown fields being 
entered.
