I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete the workshops and assignments.

The reason why we use binary files in this workshop is that binary files are 
smaller than regular text files and it is faster to write and read. I didn't use
the bind fuction in this workshop because I didn't see the need to. The bind function
is used to manipulate the position and number of values used by the function and 
modifies the function according to the desired output. The advantange of using 
multiple threads are they are so much more faster because different CPUs can run
different threads created by the program. So essentially the work is divided into
many smaller pieces. It is like working in a group to complete a big task. The way 
that I implemented multi-threading in this workshop can be seen in the findTreasure
function.

      std::thread* threads = new std::thread[rows];

      for (size_t i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
         threads[i] = std::thread([&](size_t index) { count += digForTreasure(map[index], mark); }, i);
      }

      size_t i = 0;
      while (i < rows) {
         threads[i].join();
         i++;
      }

      delete[] threads;
