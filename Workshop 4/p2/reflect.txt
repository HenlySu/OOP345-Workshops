What is the difference between the implementation of a composition and a aggregation
you may ask? To answer this question we must first understand what a composition and 
a aggregation is. To put it in simple terms, a aggregation means that one object is
the owner of another object and a composition means that one object is contained in 
another object. Hence the word "Composing".

The difference in implementation between the two is that compositions implements
complete ownership, it is responsible for destroying it's components. A composition
is also incomplete without its own components. An aggregation on the other hand does
not manage the creation or destruction of the object that it uses. The creation and
destruction lies outside of the affregatee type. It is complete even without the 
existance of an object unlike composition.
