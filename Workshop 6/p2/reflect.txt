I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete the workshops and assignments.

We need to deallocated the memory that we create in vector because the vector doesn't
deallocates the memory for us, so we have to code it ourselves manually. So to deallocate
the memory I used a for loop to loop through the size of the vector and deallocated each 
one of them and set them to a safe place, by setting them to nullptr. 

Another way of checking if the input file represents a unknown type of vehicle or invalid
data in the loadData() funtion is by doing a try and catch method. Everytime there is a 
unknown type or invalid data we can throw an exception.

In this workshop we had to use std::list<sdds::Vehicle*> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle*>
instead of std::list<sdds::Vehicle> and std::vector<sdds::Vehicle> because we are unable 
to instantiate an interface class, which means that we are unable to instantiate such 
a class.
