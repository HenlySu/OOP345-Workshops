In the Dictionary module it was necessary to add the following functions and operators:
   
   - Dictionary() - The default constructor
      - The default constructor was needed to create an object safe empty object

   - friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, const Dictionary obj);
      - The extaction operator was also implemented to display the information inside
      the dictionary object.

   - friend bool operator == (const Dictionary& LO, const Dictionary& RO);
      - The equal operator or the comparing operator was needed to be overloaded
      to compare two different Dictionary objects. This functions returns true if the
      comparison between them are the same or false otherwise.
   

The reason for specializing the push member function in the derived class is to ensure
that the numbers are identical or almost identical with the difference between them being
0.005 or less.

The reason for defining the class variable emptyObj outside the class definition is 
because static members are only allowed to be declared and not define.
