In the Dictionary module it was necessary to add the following functions:
   
   - Dictionary() - The default constructor

      - The default constructor was needed to create an object safe empty object
      
   - The Rule of Three
      - Dictionary(const Dictionary& obj) - Copy constructor
      - Dictionary& operator = (const Dictionary& obj) - Copy assignment operator
      - ~Dictionary() - The destructor

         - The rule of three was needed in order to copy one object to another in 
         the program properly.

   - friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, const Dictionary obj);

      - The extaction operator was also implemented to display the information inside
      the dictionary object.

   

The reason for specializing the push member function in the derived class is to ensure
that the numbers are identical or almost identical with the difference between them being
0.005 or less.

The reason for defining the class variable emptyObj outside the class definition is 
because static members are only allowed to be declared and not define.
